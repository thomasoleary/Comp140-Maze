## The brief
In this assignment, you are required to **create** a game or other playful experience which **interfaces** with a custom controller.

## The Game and Custom Controller
The Game:
> Maze Roller is a simple game in which the player has to roll a ball through a maze from its start to finish!
>To do this, all the player needs to do is tilt the controller! If the ball collides with a wall, a small haptic vibration alerts the player!

The Controller:
>Built within a small box, the controller uses the MPU6050 accelerometer to calculate pitch and roll! Along with this, it utilises the HC-05 module to allow the controller to be wireless. One additional feature of the controller is that it uses 4 disk motors for the haptic feedback.
